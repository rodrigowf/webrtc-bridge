It features a multi-frontend voice pipeline where multiple browser tabs connect to a single long-lived OpenAI Realtime session. You’ve got a dual AI agent system: Codex is running autonomously thread-based, while Claude is query-based with a full conversation history.\n\nRight now, you’re on the \"oauth\" branch, and there’s a new file implementing OAuth authentication for Claude. It spawns a fake PTY to interact with the Claude CLI, extracts the auth URL, and exposes endpoints for OAuth status updates. Everything's integrated in the frontend too.\n\nSome points stand out: strong structured logging, a singleton pattern for session management, and a solid event-driven architecture.\n\nOn the other hand, there are a few areas to improve: the current ANSI stripping is a bit fragile, there’s no HTTP authentication, and there’s no automated token refresh or WebRTC auto-reconnect yet.\n\nOverall, the project is well-engineered, but to be production-ready, you’d want to add authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any specific part or if you want help refining any of these areas.",
