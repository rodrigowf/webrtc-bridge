It uses a WebRTC bridge to connect multiple browser clients to a shared AI session, powered by Codex and Claude. The backend handles the AI interactions, and the whole system is built with TypeScript, Express, WebRTC, and OpenAI APIs.",

It's a well-structured voice-controlled coding agent with a backend in TypeScript running on Express, WebRTC for audio bridging, and OpenAI and Anthropic agents for code execution. The frontend is a dark-themed single-page app with real-time event streams, audio meters, and controls for managing conversations. Everything is event-driven, with a single OpenAI session serving multiple browser tabs. There’s a lot of autonomy configured for both Codex and Claude agents, and the system uses persistent markdown and JSON files for memory and conversation history. Let me know if you'd like to dive into any specific part.",
